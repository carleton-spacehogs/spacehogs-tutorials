# Tutorials and Manuals for the Spacehogs Lab

## Welcome!

You've landed on the central repository for tutorials, manuals, and how-to documents for the Spacehogs lab. In some cases, tutorials will take the form of Python scripts and example data for you to learn from and play with (e.g. the multiprocessing with Python tutorial written by Kenyon). In other cases, we'll provide links to Google Docs with manuals and explanations of how to do various things in the lab. Those are linked below. Please feel free to add to this repository; if you're not already part of the Carleton Spacehogs GitHub group and you'd like to be, let me know and I'll add you.

#### 1. Multiprocessing with Python.
See the Python scripts and files in the folder called "multiprocessing-python". Written by Kenyon Nystrom, summer 2021.

#### 2. Creating molecular clocks and reconciling gene and species trees using AnGST.
